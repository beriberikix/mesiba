# Mesiba: Framework for OpenSocial + Node.js

## Purpose

This project is my first attempt at building an OpenSocial Container on Node.js. I am also learning Node.js as I go, so it is more educational than functional. The eventual goal is to create a Node.js branch in Shindig.

For now, I probably use worst-practices and hacks - so please join the fun :)

Currently loads a gadget for a JSON store & includes explicitly-declared features. Also has POC for sharing functions between client/server with NowJS

## Immediate TODOs
* Dependency Injection for features
* Service registering
* Use real db

## Modules Used
* Express
* NowJS

##  Meaning
Mesiba means party in Hebrew. Think Shindig, Partuza, etc.
